        <p className="mb-4">
          The Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare is committed to empowering the backbone of India â€“ the Indian farmer. Our mission is to implement inclusive policies, promote innovation in agriculture, and ensure food security while uplifting the rural economy.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We work towards holistic development through schemes like PM-KISAN, Soil Health Cards, e-NAM, and crop insurance programs. By promoting sustainable agriculture and enhancing access to modern technologies, we ensure every farmer, from smallholders to large producers, has the support they need to thrive.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          With a farmer-first approach, we continuously engage in capacity building, digital access, and market linkages to make Indian agriculture globally competitive. Together, we strive for a future where agriculture is respected, profitable, and sustainable.
